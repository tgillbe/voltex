Write the minimal amount of code necessary to complete the task. Do not include functions which are not used with the view they may be needed later; only include what is necessary for the current task. Do not include any additional comments or explanations, unless the comment explains why the code is necessary, or if prompted to do so. Do not write unit tests or documentation unless explicitly asked for. Code should be clear and concise, following best practices for readability and maintainability.
